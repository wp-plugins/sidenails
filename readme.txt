SideNails allow you to display a list of the last posts with a thumbnail, in a widget. For this, SideNails use the images linked to your post (thumbnail, featured image, NextGen Gallery, etc.)

== Description ==

<a href="http://www.tranchesdunet.com/sidenails/">SideNails</a> was first developed for my own use. But I think it could be useful to someone else ;)
Basically, SideNails can do one thing :
- get an image from your post, and use it in a widget to make a thumbnail link to this post.

Of course, you can customise the "last post" : you can setup the number of posts shown, and also filter these posts by categories and/or tags.
The images used to make the thumbnails can be from the post'media library, a post'featured image, a NextGen Gallery linked to the post, or a custom fields where you setup the link to this image.
You can also change the default size (even if it's not recommanded) to your choice.

In bonus, there is also a specific template to be used with YARPP Plugin. It allow you to display the related links with the same thumbnails.

Note on the support : 
For better support, I will only answer question/suggestion/etc through a dedicaced page on my website : www.tranchesdunet.com/sidenails
You can post either in english or french (preferably).

Feel free to test it and report any bugs/suggestions
